# Running the Next.js App - Quick Start Manual

## Prerequisites

1. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine.
2. A code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text).

## Steps

### 1. Clone the Repository

Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository. Run the following command to clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SE-Nex-Tech/Nex.Tech.git
```

### 2. Navigate to the App Directory

    ```bash
    cd Nex.Tech
    ```

### 3. Install dependencies

    This command installs the necessary Node.js modules specified in the package.json file.

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### 4. Run the server

    Start the development server with the following command:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

### 5. Access the App

    Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000. You should see the Next.js app running locally.

    Any changes you make to the code will automatically trigger hot reloading, so you can see updates without restarting the server.

### 6. Stop the server

    To stop the development server, go back to the terminal where it's running and press Ctrl + C.
